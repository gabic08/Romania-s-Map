# Romania's Map

The project is not complete!! This is only the back-end program. It does not have a GUI yet.
<br>
The program calculates the distance between 2 counties from Romania and shows what counties you have to go through in order to reach your destination.
<br>
The program uses Dijkstra's algorithm that allows us to find the shortest path between any two vertices of a graph. Here, the vertices are the counties.
<br>
You can write in the console the name of the counties or their residences in order to calculate the distance between them. You can use the image to see all the counties.
